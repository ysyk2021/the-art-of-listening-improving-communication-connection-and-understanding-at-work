It recognizes that effective listening involves not only understanding the words but also interpreting the speaker's intentions, emotions, and nonverbal cues.
    
2. **Emotional Intelligence and Listening**: Emotional intelligence theorists, including Daniel Goleman, emphasized the role of empathy and interpersonal skills in effective listening. They argued that understanding and empathizing with others' emotions enhances communication and fosters meaningful connections.

Scholars like Patricia Gurin highlight the significance of listening to diverse perspectives and experiencing cultural differences actively. It promotes inclusivity, empathy, and a deeper understanding of individuals from different backgrounds.

Scholars explore how listening is influenced by virtual communication platforms, social media, and information overload. They emphasize the need for critical listening skills to navigate the digital landscape effectively.
